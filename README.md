# CNN Implemention for Visual Recognition

**Overview**

This project focuses on building an image classification model for flowers using TensorFlow. The notebook covers the following key steps:

- Data Exploration and Preprocessing:

> Import necessary libraries and load the flower dataset from Kaggle.

> Examine the dataset, visualize random flower images, and prepare the data for training.

- Data Loading and Augmentation:

> Utilize TensorFlow's ImageDataGenerator to load and augment the image dataset.

> Display visualizations of augmented images for better understanding.

- Model Building:

> Construct a model using TensorFlow's Sequential API with dense layers.

> Apply data augmentation, dropout, and batch normalization to enhance the model's performance.

- Model Training:

> Compile and train the model on the prepared dataset, utilizing the Adam optimizer and Sparse Categorical Crossentropy loss.

> Monitor and visualize training and validation accuracy and loss over epochs.

- Results Visualization:

> Display plots depicting training and validation accuracy as well as training and validation loss over epochs.


**Two Key Achievements**

- Developed an image classification model for flowers using TensorFlow, demonstrating proficiency in deep learning and computer vision.
  
- Successfully trained the model on a flower dataset, achieving insights into training and validation accuracy and loss through visualizations.
